    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Dal makhani has always been of the favorite dal recipes coming straight from the rich and flavourful Punjabi cuisine. More often this dal recipe is served with plain rice or jeera rice, however, this can also be served with rotis and garlic butter naans. This creamy dal recipe has been hugely popularised by the migrating Punjabi community within India and across the globe.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the first and essential step for this recipe is soaking the lentils and beans overnight. However, if you ever forget, you may try the canned lentil and kidney bean option. I am not a huge fan of it, yet it would save a lot of time. Secondly, for an authentic and earthly taste, prepare the dal in a clay pot or oven. I do not have access to it, so I have used my normal non-stick pan, but clay pots are highly recommended. Lastly, due to the combination of lentils and beans, the consistency may thicken once it is rested or loses its heat. You may add water and bring it to a boil so that it becomes thin. Also, if you feel it is too thin, you may boil and cook it for several minutes so that it gets thick again.</p>
