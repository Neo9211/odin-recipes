    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>One of the most popular and perhaps one of the simple and tasty North Indian paneer gravy-based curry recipes. Basically, it is prepared with the combination of paneer and green peas as its hero ingredient in a tomato and onion gravy base. It is typically served with a wide range of Indian flatbread recipes like naan, roti, and poori, but can also be served with any type of rice variants too.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tips and suggestions for a perfectly flavored matar paneer recipe. Firstly, the paneer has to be moist, juicy, and tender for this recipe for a perfect dhaba-style curry. I have used homemade paneer which is fresh and perfect for this recipe. If you are in a rush try to get fresh paneer from your local grocery store. Ensure to buy soft and moist paneer as some paneer may be hard due to adulteration. Secondly, I have used frozen green peas as I do not have access to fresh peas. If you have access to it, you should be using it instead of the frozen option. Lastly, I have not added fresh cream on top of the prepared gravy recipe. Adding cream would certainly make it tasty, but would reduce the spice level. Perhaps, it is better to increase the chili powder and garam masala and then add the cream for a better taste.</p>
