    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Okra or bhindi is a versatile vegetable and is used in different types of indian recipes. even though it is very well appreciated in indian cuisine, it can be tricky to prepare as it releases the sticky latex while cooking. keeping all those in considerations, i am posting a rich and creamy gravy recipe known as bhindi masala recipe or okra masala curry.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People complain about the sticky latex okra releases while cooking this gravy. I do understand it can be tricky to handle okra, hence i thought of re-sharing this post again with additional tips and suggestions. The first tip is to keep the okra dry. We generally wash the vegetables before using them. Firstly, we have to wash okra too but have to thoroughly wipe and dry it before slit and stuffing. The other tip is to fry it before mixing it to the gravy base. This step helps to remove all the moisture within the okra. also, it also cuts the direct contact of fresh okra with the moisture from the gravy base. I would strongly recommend not skipping this step for a perfect masala gravy base.</p>
